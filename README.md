## Todo 
<!-- * Add submit button for text box -->
<!-- * Send text through the inputs and see if you get right output. use send. STILL NEED
TEXTAREA INPUT -->
<!-- * Get tweet data -->
<!-- * Get reddit data -->
* Make IBM API work
* Make reddit data work with IBM's API with the separate files. Probably will have to 'require' ibm code.
* put reddit/twitter routes/functions in separate files. test it. MOVE FILES TO HELPERS FOLDER
* Create new ejs page to load this data(prefered) or add loading animation.
* Find ibm node package, use it.
* Styles. *** USE LANDING PAGE CSS FILE FOR THE DATA PAGE ***
* Responsiveness

### Todo later 
* Get new background color for landing
### Refactoring ideas.
Put twitter and reddit api request functions in their own js files in 'public' like Ninas-insights.
