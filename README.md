## Todo 
<!-- * Add submit button for text box -->
<!-- * Send text through the inputs and see if you get right output. use send. STILL NEED
TEXTAREA INPUT -->
<!-- * Get tweet data -->
<!-- * Get reddit data -->
<!-- * Make IBM API work -->
<!-- * Make reddit data work with IBM's API with the separate files. Probably will have to 'require' ibm code. -->
<!-- * put reddit/twitter routes/functions in separate files. test it. MOVE FILES TO HELPERS FOLDER -->
* For self text make sure the amount of words is 600. This will need to be done in client side code.
* Create new ejs page to load this data(prefered) or add loading animation.
* Find ibm node package, use it.
* Styles. *** USE LANDING PAGE CSS FILE FOR THE DATA PAGE ***
* Responsiveness. sockets
* rename routes

### Todo later 
* Get new background color for landing
### Refactoring ideas.
Put twitter and reddit api request functions in their own js files in 'public' like Ninas-insights.
